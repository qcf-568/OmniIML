### The Omni-273k dataset is now publicly available at [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/qcf568/Omni-273k/tree/main) and [BaiduCloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1UjvQlWwn8-k_cz-yRrhWSw?pwd=Omni)

<font size=10>Researchers are welcome 😃 to apply for this dataset by sending an email to  202221012612@mail.scut.edu.cn (with institution email address) and introducing:</font><br/>
1. Who you are and your institution.
2. Who is your supervisor/mentor.

Each of the pickle (.pk) file in the Omni-273k dataset contains structured text annotation for a public image forgery dataset from the four domains:
- [DocTamper](https://github.com/qcf-568/DocTamper)
- [OSTF](https://github.com/qcf-568/OSTF)
- [MIML](https://github.com/qcf-568/MIML)
- [OpenForensics](https://github.com/ltnghia/openforensics)
- [SACP](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/forum/post/164210?spm=a2c22.28136470.0.0.50634a0ag9qqww&from=search-list)
- [AutoSplice](https://github.com/shanface33/AutoSplice_Dataset)
- [CocoGlide](https://github.com/grip-unina/TruFor)
- [IMD20, NIST16, CASIA1, CASIA2, Coverage](https://github.com/greatzh/Image-Forgery-Datasets-List)

Each of the pickle file is a Python dict, where keys are corresponding image names and values are annotations.

The Omni-IML model and code are expected to be released before conference.
